1-d Theoretical Percolation

On an infinite 1-d lattice forest with a tree present at any site with probability $p$. The probability of a tree not appearing is then $1 - p$. 

The expected distribution of forest sizes $L$ is the chance that a forest will extend for $l$ sites and then be bordered by two non-tree sites. This equation for 1-d is
\[
  F(p, l)
  =
    p^l
  \addtag
\]

To find the critical point for a 1-d lattice $p_c$ we need to find when the forest creates one giant component. That is when $l$ become massive (infinte)

\[
  <l> = 
    \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}
    l p^l
\]

\[
  p_c = 
    \lim_{l \to \infty} L(p,l)
  \addtag
\]

\[
  p_c = 
    \lim_{l \to \infty} p^l 
  \addtag
\]

\[
  p_c = 1
  \addtag
\]
