So, unfortunately on my part I read problem 3 and assumed that we were coding up the HOT model for tree placement optimization. I jumped on that gun and coded up the optimization design problem for arbitrary tree sizes and probabilities. Unfortunately I read the problem more and realized I wan't even close. That code is in HOT\_trees.R in the repository.


I was however able to code up the sheep tree percolation problem but don't have any pretty graphs to show because of run time and procrastination... The code is in Problem3.R
